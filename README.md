# Code Refactor

The given code has been refactored to include the proper use of semantic html tags and a concise use of css.

Classes that could be replaced with general tags (such as header, footer etc) were altered and the css was changed with respect to this.

There was also a unnecessary repetition of certain css selectors that has the exact same declarations. In these instances html tags were unified to enable the single use of specific css declarations.

Other minor details were fixed such as adding alt tags and fixing broken links.
